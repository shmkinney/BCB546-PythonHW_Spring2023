    "# ** Your Mission: Complete Python code in a Jupyter Notebook ** #\n",
    "\n",
    "#-- Functions --#\n",
    "## 1. Document Dr. X's function with comments and with markdown text in your Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "## 2. Write a function that translates a string of nucleotides to amino acids based on Dr. X's pseudo-code suggestion.\n",
    "## 3. Write an alternative translation function.\n",
    "## 4. Write a function that calculates the molecular weight of each 3 amino acid sequence.\n",
    "## 5. Write a function that computes the GC-content of each DNA sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#-- In the MAIN part of the script --#\n",
    "## 6. Add two new columns to the penguin DataFrame: (1) molecular weight and (2) GC content.\n",
    "## 7. Call your functions from step 3 (or step 2) and step 4 and fill in the new columns in the DataFrame.\n",
    "## 8. Plot a bar-chart of adult body mass per species. In your description of the graph, provide text that answers these questions: \n",
    "#       a. What is the smallest penguin species? \n",
    "#       b. What is the geographical range of this species?\n",
    "## 9. Plot a graph that shows the molecular weight as a function of GC content. \n",
    "## 10. Write the entire DataFrame to a new CSV file that includes your new columns.\n",
    "## 11. BONUS: What other visualizations, functions or tasks would you do with this dataset? Add something interesting for fun. (0.5 additional points if your total score is < 15).\n",
    "\n",
    "#-- Additional Instructions (points will be deducted if these instructions are not heeded) --#\n",
    "## ** Do all of this in a Jupyter notebook and push it to a GitHub repository.\n",
    "## ** Your repository should not contain any files other than those associated with this assignment. \n",
    "## ** Read all comments carefully and answer the questions by including information in your Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "## ** Document all of your code (and Dr. X's code) very thoroughly so that it is clear what you did.\n",
    "## ** Be sure to cite (by providing URLs or other appropriate citations) information appropriately in your documented notebook.\n",
    "## ** Commit and push your completed work in the Jupyter notebook to your repository.\n",
    "## ** Submit the URL to your git repository via Canvas by the end of the day on May 6, 2022.\n",
